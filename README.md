# Project Description

# Roles
  * Backend / Database Development: 
     * Phase 1: Requirements analysis and design of an E-R model
     * Phase 2: Transformation of the E-R model into a concrete logical model
  
  * Frontend / User-Interface Development:

# Brainstorm

 * Determine the main functionalities and operations of the database application. Think about 
the various requirements of the user of your application and the various data attributes that 
need to be stored and later queried. 

Project Deliverable 1 / Phase 1 Questions:
* What are the main functions that the web-based user interface should provide? 
* How do the different functions work together? Sometimes there are dependencies between 
different functions. 
* What (colloquial) queries are important for the application? 
* Which  public  domain  and/or  proprietary  software  is  needed  to  perform  the  task?  (The 
database system used must be CISE Oracle.) 

  * Model  the  data  to  be  stored  in  the  database,  i.e.,  identify  the  various  entities, 
relationships, constraints, etc. by creating an ER diagram.

E-R Diagram:
 * 1. Identify (weak) entity
 * 2. Draw (weak) entity sets
 * 3. Identify (key) attributes of (weak) entity sets
 * 4. Draw (key) attributes of (weak) entity sets
 * 5. Identify (identifying) relationship sets
 * 6. Draw (identifying) relationship sets
 * 7. Identify attributes of (identifying) relationship sets
 * 8. Draw attributes of (identifying) relationships sets
 * 9. Insert cardinalities
